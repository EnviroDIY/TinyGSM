A small Arduino library for GPRS modules, that just works

Currently only SIM800/SIM900 are tested.  
More modules may be supported later.

## Getting started

  1. Using your phone:
    - Disable PIN code on the SIM card
    - Check your ballance
    - Check that APN,User,Pass are correct and you have internet
  2. Ensure the sim card is correctly inserted into the module
  3. Provide a good, stable power supply (up to 2A)
     (4.0-4.2V or 5V according to your module documentation)
  4. Provide good, stable serial connection
     (Hardware Serial is recommended)
  5. Check if GSM antenna is attached
